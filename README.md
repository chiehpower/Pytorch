Recently we found that people using Pytorch for deep learning have become more and more. I thought that there are two main reasons. 

First, Pytorch is easier to be learned that its logic is intuitive as same as python. 

Second, Pytorch can be easier to control the GPU that you can directly assign your device by one command line.   

So why not to learn it? 

If you can manipulate both deep learning frameworks, you will not be restricted in one of frameworks.

- Practice_from_Website
  - Which practiced from website where provided some simple tutorials. In addition, I also did some testing by my self.
- Practice_from_book
  - My practice sources from:
    [Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-pytorch-for/9781492045342/)
- Functions_study
  - There are few functions that I wanna try and study its property.

# Functions study
  - numpy_ops:
    - `np.tile`
    - `np.clip`
  - torch_ops:
    - `Torch.topk`
    - `Torch.cat`
    - `LocalResponseNorm`
    - `Torch.from_numpy`
